# Book Assignment View

This project showcases a solution for the Ello Engineering Challenge, specifically the Book Assignment View. It enables users to add and remove books from a list, demonstrating the ability to build a dynamic user interface (frontend) and integrate it with a GraphQL server (backend) to manage book data.

## Features

- Frontend: React
- UI Framework: Material-UI
- Styling: "Mulish" Google Font
- Backend: GraphQL Server
- Data: The GraphQL server provides a single query named books that returns a list of book objects including title, author, and cover photo URL.
